  What is Q Learning? What does the Q stand for (and what about the "Learning")?
      * is an algorithm that learns the value of an action in a particular state. Q stands for quality

  What is RL (Reinforcement Learning) and how does it relate to ML (Machine Learning)?
      * RL is the training of machine learning models to make a sequence of decisions.

  What does it mean for Q Learning to be "model-free"?
      * Q learning does not require a model of the environment

  What, if anything, is Q Learning often used for? (If you find any cool projects or research relating to Q Learning, feel free to link them to me!)
      *seeks to find the best action to take given the current state 
      can be used for building a self-playing PacMan agent
